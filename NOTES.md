3. Inline Matplotlib
4. Data source vs. type differentiation
5. Peer-to-peer synchronization
6. Background file tracking
7. Virtual filesystem

ANSWERS:
- All pages that aren't columns should be closed by default, until manually
    opened in which case the state should be saved
- Upon indent of items, the page should be expanded
- Columns w/in columns shouldn't be allowed, render as collapsed page
- Pages which are recursive should have any iteration after the first
    instance automatically collapsed regardless of saved state

QUESTIONS:
- How should rendering options be implemented in situations where the same
    element might be rendered differently depending on its location
- How to maintain parent path information for breadcrumbs
- How to handle selections of markdown elements vs. within markdown elements
    considering the transition from text -> rendered.
- How to handle selections between contiguous text elements
- How to handle paste of multi-media content into text and other elemnets
